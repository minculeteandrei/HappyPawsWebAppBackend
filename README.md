How To Contribute
PLEASE DON'T COMMIT DIRECTLY TO THE MASTER BRANCH!!!
Have a github account, and a tool of your choice for using git (I am using Git Bash). Some IDEs have integrated Git support (which is easy to use). You can also use Git with an interface if it's easier for you

Clone this repo: git clone (url from Code button)

Create a branch for your features: git checkout -b (descriptive-branch-name-with-no-spaces)

Try to only make changes to relevant files (i.e. if you work with the database, try not to modify the entire structure of the project, or make changes in the algorithms as this will create conflicts with branches of other people)

For transparency, open a draft PR whenever you have some work ready to show: Go to Pull requests tab on Github, New Pull Request, Select base as master, and compare as your branch name: descriptive-branch-name-with-no-spaces

Wait for people to a) request changes to your branch, or b) approve your pull request

If there are no requested changes to your code, you can merge your pull request

Always try to keep the master branch functional and free of bugs!
